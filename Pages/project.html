                            A mobile app that tracks your personal spending with an AI right by your side! 
                            We targeted students and young adults to help them understand the importance of their finances and how to save better.

                            Out of <strong>over 250</strong> projects, this one placed in the <strong>Top 20</strong> at Florida's largest Hackathon, ShellHacks. 
                            This project was built with only 36-hours.
                            I worked on the front-end using React Native and Expo, helping design a clean, simple, and user-friendly UI with vibrant orange buttons placed within thumbs' reach.
                            I also contributed to the backend by testing API endpoints using Postman and helping build core functionalities.

                            A personal website built to showcase my projects, experiences, and passions in tech and design. 
                            With a smooth layout and a modern aesthetic, this site was designed to reflect both personality and professionalism while staying accessible and easy to navigate.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            I designed the layout using Canva and developed the site with HTML and CSS. 
                            For the background, I integrated a JavaScript animation using a pre-built template to give the site a modern, dynamic feel. 
                            While the website is currently optimized for laptop screens only, it serves as a clean and professional space to highlight who I am and what I do.
